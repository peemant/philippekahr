    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <P>
        Well, Biff. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. 
        Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. 
        You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. 
        The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow.
